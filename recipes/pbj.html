    <h2> What is PB&J ?</h2>
    <p> If you're unsure, ask any child what a PB&J is! Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches are a favorite amongst children (and many adults, too)!
        This is likely because the quick and easy treat is sweet, yet packed with good protein!
        The ease with wich PB&J can be made, even by a hungry child, makes it one of the most popular foods that can be whipped up in a matter of minutes.</p>
        <p> There are lots of differents ways people like to make their PB&Js, so let's just go over a very basic recipe. </p>

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Peanut Butter (your choice of smooth or chunky)</li>
            <li> Jelly, Jam, or Preserves (your choice, but I prefer jelly) </li>
            <li> Bread! (We should all be eating yummy Wheat bread, we can talk about White bread later)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <p> There is no right way to put this quick and easy sandwich together, but for this example I will tell you my preferred way!</p>
        <ol> 
            <li> Gather up all the ingredients you will need and a clean plate </li>
            <li> With two slices of bread on your plate, begin to apply Peanut Butter to one of them</li>
            <li> With your Peanut Butter applied, now begin to apply your Jelly to the other slice of bread</li>
            <li> With both slices of bread now covered with Peanut Butter and Jelly respectively, we will join the slices! </li>
            <li> Gently combine both slices of bread with the Peanut Butter and Jelly facing each other.</li>
            <li> Once joined, you will have a delectable treat to enjoy and provie yourself with some much needed energy! </li>
        </ol>
