# odin-recipes

This will serve as the explanation of how I have spent the last, oh.. probably hour of my life.
The purpose of the Odin-Recipes repos is to improve my skills of web development. Specifically, this has been heavily focused on HTML currently.

I have been working to successfully create and edit HMTL documents, utilize Git to add and commit these changes, and viewing these changes as they present in the browser.

This project has allowed me to hone my muscle memory for utilzing the command line to control Git, while also allowing me to delevop a better understanding of webpage coding and what it should look like.

Thank you for taking the time to view my work.
